GPS Geo-Scanner is a placable tool added in the [GPS](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/GPS) category.

## Obtaining
GPS Geo-Scanner can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage
Right-Clicking on a placed GPS Geo-Scanner opens a chest GUI with the overview of minable resources of a given chunk.

These resources are only minable using an [Oil Pump](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Oil-Pump) or a [GEO Miner](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/GEO-Miner).

Scanning requires a [GPS network complexity](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/GPS-Transmitter) of at least 600.
